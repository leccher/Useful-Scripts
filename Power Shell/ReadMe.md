# PowerShell Useful Scripts
This section of the Useful Scripts contains some scripts in Power Shell v7 or more.
Not all peaple knows that Power Shell in windows has two souls: one called **Windows Power Shell** 
that is a specific version of powershell used to manage many interfaces and features in windows, 
and **PowerShell**, that is the most evoluted version of powershell and can run over different OS.

The most important thing to know is those are not compatible one with the other.
* Windows PowerShell refers to a 5.x version of the script language
* PoweShell refers to a version grather 7 and is available also in Linux and Mac OS.

This rrepository contains only scripts for **PowerSehll** that are in my opinion useful for a developer using Windows shell.
